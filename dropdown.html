        <p>By the time that I'm writing this post, I am moving to the 4th week of the program. So far, I met incredible people from different cultures and regions of the world. We are in a constant sharing knowledge environment, where we not only learn about coding but also about being a world citizen. Of course, not everything is hunky-dory, we sometimes have to give in some initial ideas to the better of the group, especially when we are working with our coding partner. All in all, If you are interested in joining the Microverse Program, I strongly suggest you do it! Microverse staff is really helpful and they are in constant evolution. They really care about the students and, even better, you getting a job is also what they want, because we only pay when we get paid.

            If you are still in doubt and want to know more about it, I'm writing the second part of this post where I'm going to talk about how it is a daily life of a microverse student, what platform we use to learn and how they keep track and take care of us.

            Disclaimer: I'm not sure which step came first if it was the 'coding challenge' or 'record a video'.
